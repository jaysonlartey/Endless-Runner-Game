# Endless Runner Game

## Project Overview
The **Endless Runner Game** is a side-view, fast-paced game where the player controls a character running through a dynamic, randomly generated landscape filled with obstacles and power-ups. The goal is to keep the character alive as long as possible by jumping or sliding to avoid obstacles, collecting power-ups, and surviving increasingly difficult challenges.

The game ends when the character collides with an obstacle, hole, or enemy, and the player's score is based on how far they managed to run before the game ended.

## Purpose and Context
This project was created as part of the **Game Programming** course to apply game development concepts in building an interactive game. The idea is to explore **game mechanics**, **UI/UX design**, and **game state management** while implementing features such as **random level generation** and **progressive difficulty**. The game is inspired by popular games like **Geometry Dash**, **Subway Surfers**, and **Extreme Pamplona**.

## Key Features
- **Keyboard Controls**: Players can control the character using keyboard inputs (`SPACE` for jumping and `S` for sliding).
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game's speed and obstacle frequency increase as the player advances, providing a progressively more challenging experience.
- **Score Tracking**: The player’s score is based on the distance they run, and the game ends when they hit an obstacle or fall into a hole.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays the player’s final score and offers options to replay or exit.


## Asset Sources
The game uses assets from the following sources:
- **Images**: Images are sourced from [OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/).
- **Sounds**: Sound effects are sourced from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org).

## Future Improvements
- Adding **multiplayer mode** for a more competitive experience.
- **Leaderboard system** for high scores to increase engagement.
